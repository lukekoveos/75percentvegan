## The Story

I'm Luke, and I started the 75% Vegan movement because I was tired of the all-or-nothing mentality around plant-based eating.

I've seen too many people:
- Want to reduce their meat consumption
- Feel overwhelmed by vegan perfectionism
- Give up before they even start

**There had to be a better way.**

## Why This Matters

The environmental impact of food is real. Animal welfare matters. Personal health is important.

But rigid, dogmatic approaches push people away. **75% Vegan is the middle ground that actually works.**
