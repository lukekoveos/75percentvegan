## The Short Version

I got tired of the all-or-nothing approach to eating.

100% vegan felt like too much commitment. 0% felt like ignoring a real problem. So I did what engineers do: I found a middle ground that actually works.

**75% plant-based. 25% whatever. 100% sustainable.**

## The Math

One person eating 100% vegan: **1 person's impact**

Four people eating 75% plant-based: **3 people's worth of impact**

The second approach is three times more effective — and infinitely more achievable.

Perfection is the enemy of progress. Always has been.

## Who's Behind This

I'm Luke. I'm not a chef, nutritionist, or wellness guru. I'm just someone who likes food, hates dogma, and can do basic arithmetic.

I also make music. The 75% Vegan project started as a [music movement](/music/) — songs in 30 styles and languages promoting a global shift toward eating less meat.

The recipes came later, when I realized I needed to actually show people *how* to do this.

## The 75% Promise

**Nothing is sacred.**

If a recipe says "loads of garlic" and you don't have garlic, use something else. If a principle says 75% and you hit 60%, that's still better than 0%.

Progress. Over. Perfection.
