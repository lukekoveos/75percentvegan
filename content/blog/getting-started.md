## Step 1: Stop Calling It a Diet

This isn't a diet. It's not a lifestyle. It's just... eating slightly differently. Don't overthink it.

## Step 2: Pick Your Two Easy Meals

**Breakfast and lunch are your low-hanging fruit.**

Most people already eat cereal, toast, oatmeal, or fruit for breakfast. Already plant-based. Done.

Lunch? Sandwiches, salads, wraps. Easy swaps:
- Hummus instead of deli meat
- Peanut butter instead of cheese
- Beans instead of chicken

**Boom. You're at 66% without even trying.**

## Step 3: Make Dinner Mostly Plant-Based

You don't have to go full vegan at dinner. Just make it **mostly** plants.

Examples:
- Pasta with marinara (add veggies)
- Stir-fry with tofu or chickpeas
- Tacos with black beans
- Curry with lentils

**That's it. You're now at 75%+.**

## Step 4: Don't Be Weird About It

Social dinner? Birthday? Traveling? **Eat what you want.**

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is consistency. If you're plant-based 75% of the time, you're already making a massive impact.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trying to replicate meat
Don't chase fake meat. Just eat plants. Beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu—these are whole foods, not weird science experiments.

### Mistake 2: Obsessing over labels
You're not "vegan." You're not "flexitarian." You're just a person who eats mostly plants. No label needed.

### Mistake 3: Being preachy
Nobody likes preachy people. Just do your thing and let your results speak.

## The Mental Shift

**You're not giving up meat. You're choosing plants most of the time.**

Subtle difference, but it matters. One feels like deprivation. The other feels like a choice.
