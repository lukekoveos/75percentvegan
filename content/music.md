## Music for the Movement

The 75% Vegan philosophy isn't just about food — it's a movement. And every movement needs a soundtrack.

Luke created **World Songs with a Strong Message** — over 40 versions of the same song in different languages, all delivering the message of eating more plants and less meat.

**The message is simple:** You don't need to be 100% vegan. 50%, 60%, 75% is far more achievable for far more people. The total change would be massive.

## About the Project

This started as a creative experiment: What if one message could reach people in their own language? Not preaching, not lecturing — just a simple song saying "eat a bit more veg."

Over 40 versions. Multiple languages. One message.

**Join the movement. Spread the 75% approach.**
