## 🎵 A Song for Everyone

The 75% Vegan movement started with music.

A song in 30 musical styles. Almost as many languages. A message of hope that transcends borders and diets alike.

Because change doesn't come from preaching. It comes from connection.

## The World Music Festival

The 75% Vegan World Music Movement Festival promotes a worldwide shift towards a less meat, more veg diet.

True Vegan or Vegetarian can be a bridge too far for many. And if the bridge is too far... why start?

Let's readdress the definition. Make a more achievable target. One that **all** can aim for.

## Why Music?

Food connects people. So does music.

Both are universal languages. Both are better when shared. Both are about enjoyment, not perfection.

You don't have to be a professional musician to enjoy music.  
You don't have to be 100% vegan to make a difference.

**75% is enough. In everything.**
