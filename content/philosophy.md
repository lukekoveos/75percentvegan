## Why 75%?

The all-or-nothing approach to veganism fails most people. You either commit to 100% perfection, or you don't try at all. **This is backwards.**

If everyone ate 75% plant-based, we'd make a bigger impact than a tiny minority eating 100% vegan.

## The Math That Matters

- **One person going 100% vegan:** 1 person eating plant-based
- **Four people going 75% vegan:** 3 people's worth of plant-based eating

The second option is three times the impact—and it's achievable for almost everyone.

## Progress Over Perfection

- **You don't need to be perfect.** You need to be consistent.
- **You don't need to convert.** You need to reduce.
- **You don't need guilt.** You need practical strategies.

## How It Works

### The 75% Rule
- Eat plant-based for **breakfast and lunch** (that's already 66%)
- Keep **most dinners plant-based** (bringing you to 75%+)
- Allow flexibility for social events, travel, and life

### No Dogma
- Not interested in labels
- Not interested in judgment
- Not interested in perfection

### Real Impact
- Better for the planet
- Better for animals
- Better for your health
- **Actually sustainable long-term**

## Join the Movement

75% Vegan isn't a diet. It's a realistic approach to eating that makes a difference without dominating your life.

**Progress beats perfection. Every time.**
