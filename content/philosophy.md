## Why 75%?

The all-or-nothing approach to veganism fails most people. You either commit to 100% perfection, or you don't try at all. **This is backwards.**

If everyone ate 75% plant-based, we'd make a bigger impact than a tiny minority eating 100% vegan.

## The Math That Matters

- **One person going 100% vegan:** 1 person eating plant-based
- **Four people going 75% vegan:** 3 people's worth of plant-based eating

The second option is three times the impact—and it's achievable for almost everyone.

## Progress Over Perfection

- **You don't need to be perfect.** You need to be consistent.
- **You don't need to convert.** You need to reduce.
- **You don't need guilt.** You need practical strategies.

## Be Kind to Future Self

This is the principle that ties everything together.

When you cook a big batch of 75% chili and freeze half of it, you're being kind to future you — the tired, hungry, Wednesday-night version of you who doesn't feel like cooking. That person opens the freezer and finds a home-cooked meal waiting. That's kindness.

And the principle scales up:

- **Cook more than you need today** → Future you eats well without effort
- **Eat less meat this week** → Future you lives on a planet that's slightly less wrecked
- **Make it easy for yourself** → Future you actually sticks with it
- **Stick with it** → Future everyone benefits — animals, oceans, forests, the lot

Being kind to future self isn't selfish. It's the most practical form of caring there is. You're not saving the world with one meal. You're making it slightly better, one freezer bag at a time.

**Every recipe on this site makes more than you need.** That's by design. Eat tonight, freeze the rest. Be kind to future you.

## How It Works

### The 75% Rule
- Eat plant-based for **breakfast and lunch** (that's already 66%)
- Keep **most dinners plant-based** (bringing you to 75%+)
- Allow flexibility for social events, travel, and life

### The Batch Principle
- Every recipe serves 6-8 (not 2)
- Cook once, eat three times
- Freeze in portions — label with date and contents
- Future you will thank present you

### No Dogma
- Not interested in labels
- Not interested in judgment
- Not interested in perfection

### Real Impact
- Better for the planet
- Better for animals
- Better for your health
- Better for future you
- **Actually sustainable long-term**

## Join the Movement

75% Vegan isn't a diet. It's a realistic approach to eating that makes a difference without dominating your life. Cook big. Freeze smart. Be kind to your future self — and to everything else on this planet.

**Progress beats perfection. Every time.**
