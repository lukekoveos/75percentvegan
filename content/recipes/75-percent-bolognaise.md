## The Philosophy in a Bowl

This is it. The recipe that proves the 75% approach works.

75% plant-based mince. 25% beef. The result? A bolognaise that tastes exactly like the one you grew up with — but with a fraction of the environmental impact.

Your meat-loving family won't notice. Your conscience will thank you.

## The 75% Principle

| Component | Amount | Percentage |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Soya mince | 1 pack | 37.5% |
| Pea mince | 2 packs | 50% |
| Beef mince | 1 pack | 12.5% |

*Okay, it's actually more like 87% plant-based. Even better.*

## Ingredients

### The Protein Mix
- 1 pack minced beef (about 400g)
- 1 pack soya mince
- 2 packs pea mince (like Beyond or similar)

### The Vegetables (load them up)
- 4 large onions, diced
- Loads of carrots, diced small
- Sweet peppers (1 green if you can, rest red/yellow), diced
- Loads of garlic, minced (seriously, don't be shy)

### The Spice Rack
- Cinnamon (generous pinch — trust me)
- 2 star anise
- 3-4 cloves
- Nutmeg (freshly grated if possible)
- Oregano (dried is fine)
- Paprika
- Salt and black pepper

### The Liquid
- Good glass of red wine (whatever you're drinking)
- Beef or vegetable stock (your call on how far you want to go)
- 2 large cans chopped tomatoes
- 1 large jar passata

### The Balance
- 1-2 tsp sugar
- Splash of red wine vinegar or balsamic

## Instructions

### 1. Brown the Proteins
Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan (or Dutch oven) over medium-high heat. Brown the beef mince first — let it get some color. Remove and set aside.

In the same pan, brown the soya and pea mince. It won't brown quite the same, but you want it to dry out a bit. Remove and combine with the beef.

### 2. Build the Base
Add more oil if needed. Sauté the onions until soft and starting to caramelize — this takes 10 minutes, don't rush it.

Add the carrots and peppers. Cook another 5 minutes.

Add the garlic. Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

### 3. The Spice Magic
Add all your spices: cinnamon, star anise, cloves, nutmeg, oregano, paprika. Stir everything together. Cook for 2 minutes — your kitchen should smell incredible.

### 4. Deglaze with Wine
Pour in the red wine. Let it bubble and scrape up any fond from the bottom of the pan. This is where the flavor lives.

### 5. Add the Proteins Back
Return all the mince to the pan. Stir to combine with the vegetables and spices.

### 6. The Tomato Stage
Add the chopped tomatoes, passata, and stock. Stir well.

Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. 

### 7. The Long Simmer
Let it bubble gently for at least 30 minutes. The longer the better — an hour is ideal if you have time.

### 8. Balance the Flavors
This is important: taste your sauce. Add sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Add vinegar for brightness. Adjust salt and pepper.

The sauce should be rich, deep, and balanced — not too sweet, not too acidic.

### 9. Serve
Toss with your favorite pasta. Top with fresh basil if you have it. Parmesan is not 75% vegan but hey, nothing is sacred.

**Total time:** About 1 hour 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate (but really just requires patience)  
**Cost:** ~£12 for 6+ generous servings

## Tips & Variations

### Make it Easier
- Skip the star anise and cloves if you don't have them — it'll still be great
- Use pre-diced frozen vegetables if you're short on time
- A slow cooker works beautifully — brown everything first, then 6-8 hours on low

### Make it Different
- **75% Lasagne:** Layer this sauce with béchamel and pasta sheets
- **75% Cottage Pie:** Top with mashed potatoes and bake
- **75% Stuffed Peppers:** Fill pepper halves and bake at 180°C for 25 minutes

### The "Nothing is Sacred" Notes
- No red wine? Use extra stock plus a splash of balsamic
- No star anise? Skip it
- Different plant mince? Use whatever's on sale
- Only have one type of mince? Use 3 packs of it and 1 pack beef
- Don't like peppers? More carrots instead

**The principle is what matters, not the precision.**

## Why This Works

The beef provides the familiar "meaty" flavor and fat. The plant proteins provide bulk, protein, and absorb all those incredible spices.

After simmering together, everything melds. The textures blend. Your brain registers "bolognaise" and moves on.

That's the whole point of 75% Vegan. You don't sacrifice taste. You don't sacrifice satisfaction. You just... shift the ratio.
