## The One-Pot Wonder

Chili is already halfway there. Most good chili recipes are loaded with beans and vegetables anyway. We just lean into it harder.

This is a Sunday-afternoon, fill-the-house-with-smell, eat-it-all-week kind of recipe. Make the full batch. Thank yourself on Wednesday.

## The 75% Chili Base

| Ingredient | Amount | Role |
|------------|--------|------|
| Kidney beans | 2 cans | Protein + bulk |
| Black beans | 1 can | Variety + texture |
| Vegetables | 3 cups total | Nutrition + volume |
| Beef mince | 200g | Richness + umami |

## Ingredients

### The Protein
- 2 cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 200g (about 1/2 lb) beef mince

### The Vegetables
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 bell peppers (any color), diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, grated (disappears into the sauce — stealth nutrition)
- 1 stick celery, finely diced

### The Sauce
- 2 cans (400g each) chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup vegetable stock (or water with a stock cube)

### The Spices
- 2 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp cayenne (optional — for heat lovers)
- 1 tsp cocoa powder (trust the process)
- Salt and pepper

### To Serve
- Rice, cornbread, or tortilla chips
- Sour cream or vegan alternative
- Grated cheese (optional)
- Sliced spring onions
- Fresh cilantro

## Instructions

### 1. Brown the Beef
Heat a splash of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef mince. Break it up and brown it, about 5 minutes.

### 2. Soften the Veg
Add onion, peppers, celery, and carrot. Cook 5-7 minutes until softened. Add garlic, cook 1 minute more.

### 3. Spice It Up
Add ALL the spices: chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, cayenne, cocoa powder. Stir everything together. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

{{< recipe-tip title="The Cocoa Thing" type="philosophy" >}}
Yes, cocoa powder in chili. No, it won't taste like chocolate. It adds depth, richness, and a slightly smoky undertone. This is what separates good chili from great chili. Mexican mole has been doing this for centuries.

### 4. Add the Liquids
Pour in both cans of tomatoes, the tomato paste, and the stock. Stir well.

### 5. Add the Beans
Dump in all three cans of drained beans. Stir.

### 6. Simmer
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes minimum. 45 minutes is better. An hour is perfect.

Stir occasionally. Add water if it gets too thick.

### 7. Taste and Adjust
More salt? Probably yes. More heat? Your call. More cumin? Never a bad idea.

**Total time:** 55 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Cost:** ~£10 for 6 generous servings

## Tips

### Make it easier
- Skip the fresh veg — frozen mixed peppers and onions work great
- Use a spice packet if you don't have everything
- Slow cooker version: Brown beef first, then dump everything in. Low for 6-8 hours.

### Make it different
- **Loaded nachos:** Pour over tortilla chips, top with cheese, grill 5 min
- **Chili dogs:** You know what to do
- **Stuffed peppers:** Hollow out bell peppers, fill with chili, bake 25 min at 180°C
- **Chili cheese fries:** Because sometimes you just need it

### Batch Cooking Hero
This recipe makes 6 big portions. Here's what to do with them:
- **Eat 2 tonight** (you and your dinner companion)
- **Fridge 2** for lunches this week
- **Freeze 2** in labelled containers for future you

Frozen chili keeps 3 months. Future you will send a thank-you note.
