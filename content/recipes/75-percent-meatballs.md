## The Meatball Problem

Meatballs are sacred. Touch them wrong and people riot.

So we didn't touch them wrong. These are dense, savory, hold-together-on-a-fork meatballs. The secret? Cooked lentils and oats do the heavy lifting. The beef does the convincing.

## The 75% Meatball Mix

| Ingredient | Amount | Role |
|------------|--------|------|
| Cooked green/brown lentils | 2 cans | Bulk + protein + binding |
| Rolled oats | 1 cup | Texture + binding |
| Beef mince | 1 pack | Flavor + fat |

## Ingredients

### The Meatballs
- 2 cans green or brown lentils, drained
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1 pack beef mince (400-500g — standard pack size)
- 2 eggs (the glue)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 tbsp dried)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Quick Tomato Sauce
- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp sugar (cuts the acidity)
- Salt and pepper
- Fresh basil if you have it

### To Serve
- Spaghetti, crusty bread, or just a fork and zero shame

## Instructions

### 1. Mash the Lentils
In a bowl, roughly mash the lentils with a fork. You want about half mashed, half whole — gives texture without being mushy.

### 2. Mix Everything
Add the oats, beef mince, egg, garlic, onion, parsley, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix with your hands until just combined.

{{< recipe-tip title="Don't Overwork It" >}}
Mix until it holds together, then stop. Overworked meatballs = tough meatballs. Nobody wants that.

### 3. Shape
Roll into golf ball–sized meatballs. You should get about 16. Place on a plate or tray.

### 4. Brown Them
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs in batches — don't crowd the pan. Brown on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. They don't need to cook through yet.

### 5. Make the Sauce
In the same pan (all those brown bits = flavor), add garlic. Cook 30 seconds. Pour in crushed tomatoes, basil, sugar, salt, pepper. Stir.

### 6. Simmer Together
Nestle the meatballs into the sauce. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 15 minutes until meatballs are cooked through and sauce has thickened.

### 7. Serve
Over pasta. With bread. Straight from the pan. We don't judge.

**Total time:** 45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Cost:** ~£9 for 4 servings

## Tips

### Make it easier
- Use canned lentils — zero cooking required
- Instant oats work just as well as rolled
- Jarred marinara instead of making sauce from scratch

### Make it different
- **Swedish style:** Add a pinch of allspice and nutmeg, serve with mashed potatoes and lingonberry
- **BBQ meatballs:** Skip the tomato sauce, toss in BBQ sauce, serve as appetizers
- **Sub sandwich:** Stuff into a hoagie roll with melted cheese

### Be Kind to Future Self
This recipe makes a big batch. Here's the plan:
- **Eat tonight** with pasta and sauce
- **Fridge a portion** for tomorrow's lunch (sub sandwich, anyone?)
- **Freeze the rest** in bags of 4-5 meatballs — reheat straight from frozen in sauce for 15 minutes

Frozen meatballs keep 3 months. Wednesday-night-you will be grateful.

### The Lentil Secret
Lentils are the unsung hero of 75% cooking. They're cheap (£1 a can), packed with protein and fiber, and they take on whatever flavor you throw at them. Cooked lentils in meatballs = invisible. The texture blends right in.

**Stock up.** You'll use them constantly.
