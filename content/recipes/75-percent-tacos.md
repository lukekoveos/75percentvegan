## Why Taco Tuesday Gets a Makeover

Everyone loves tacos. Nobody wants to give them up.

Good news: you don't have to. The 75% approach turns regular taco night into something your conscience (and your wallet) can feel good about.

{{< principle-box plant="75" meat="25" >}}

## The 75% Taco Mix

Instead of 2 packs of beef, we use:

| Ingredient | Amount | Role |
|------------|--------|------|
| Black beans | 1 can (drained) | Bulk + protein |
| TVP (textured vegetable protein) | 2 cups (rehydrated) | Meaty texture |
| Beef mince | 1 pack | Familiar flavor |

Total protein content is actually *higher* than all-beef tacos. Mind blown? Same.

## Ingredients

### The Protein
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 2 cups TVP, rehydrated in hot water
- 1 pack beef mince

### The Seasoning
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt and pepper
- Splash of lime juice

### To Serve
- Taco shells or soft tortillas (8-10)
- Shredded lettuce
- Diced tomatoes
- Cheese (optional — skip for extra plant points)
- Sour cream or vegan alternative
- Hot sauce
- Fresh cilantro
- Lime wedges

## Instructions

### 1. Prep the TVP
Pour 2 cups TVP into a bowl. Cover with hot water or vegetable stock. Let sit 10 minutes until rehydrated. Drain excess liquid.

### 2. Brown the Beef
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the beef mince. Break it up as it cooks. Once browned, don't remove — we're building on it.

### 3. Add the Plants
Add the drained black beans and rehydrated TVP to the skillet with the beef. Stir to combine.

### 4. Season Everything
Add all the spices: cumin, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, chili powder. Stir well. Cook for 3-4 minutes until everything is heated through and fragrant.

Add a splash of water if it gets too dry. Finish with lime juice.

### 5. Taste and Adjust
This is important. Taste your taco filling. Need more salt? Add it. More cumin? Go for it. More heat? Pile on the chili.

**Nothing is sacred.**

### 6. Assemble
Warm your shells. Load them up. Don't be shy with the toppings.

**Total time:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Cost:** ~£10 for 4 servings

## Tips

### Make it easier
- Use a taco seasoning packet instead of individual spices
- Canned refried beans work if you can't find TVP
- Pre-shredded cheese and bagged lettuce = no shame

### Make it different
- **Taco bowl:** Skip the shells, serve over rice
- **Nachos:** Same filling, over chips with melted cheese
- **Lettuce wraps:** Low-carb version

### The TVP Question
"What the hell is TVP?"

Textured Vegetable Protein. Made from soybeans. Cheap, shelf-stable, takes on whatever flavor you cook it with. Find it in the health food aisle or online.

Don't have it? Use an extra can of beans. Or crumbled firm tofu. Or more beef and less plant if that's what you have.

**The principle matters more than the precision.**
