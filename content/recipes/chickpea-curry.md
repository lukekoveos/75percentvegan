## Why This Works

This curry is stupid simple, uses pantry staples, and tastes better than takeout. It's my go-to weeknight dinner.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans chickpeas, drained
- 1 can coconut milk
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- Salt, pepper
- Rice or naan to serve

## Instructions

1. Sauté onion and garlic in a large pan until soft
2. Add curry powder, cook for 1 minute (smells amazing)
3. Add tomatoes, coconut milk, chickpeas
4. Simmer 15 minutes
5. Season with salt and pepper
6. Serve over rice

**Total time:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Cost:** ~$8 for 4 servings

## Tips

- Add spinach at the end for extra greens
- Double the batch and freeze leftovers
- Adjust curry powder to taste (I use 3 tbsp because I like it strong)
