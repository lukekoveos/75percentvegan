## Low and Slow, Big and Bold

Here's a thing about smoked tofu in curry: it absorbs spice like nothing else. Every piece becomes a little flavour bomb. Add chunks of slow-cooked lamb and you've got a curry that rivals any takeaway — at a fraction of the environmental cost.

This is a big-batch, fill-the-freezer, eat-all-week kind of recipe. Make it on Sunday. Thank yourself until Friday.

## Ingredients

### The Protein (3:1)
- 1 pack lamb shoulder or neck fillet (400-500g), cut into 3cm chunks
- 2 packs smoked tofu (400g each), cut into chunky rectangles
- 1 pack firm tofu (400g), cut into chunky rectangles

### The Base
- 2 large onions, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, grated
- Thumb of ginger, grated
- 2 fresh chillies, sliced (or 1 tsp chilli powder)
- 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
- 1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes
- 200ml stock or water

### The Spice Mix
- 2 tbsp curry powder (medium or hot, your call)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp garam masala (add at the end)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

### To Finish
- Handful of fresh coriander
- Squeeze of lime
- Basmati rice or naan

## Instructions

### 1. Brown the Lamb
Heat oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Season the lamb with salt. Brown in batches — 3-4 minutes per side. Get proper colour. Remove and set aside.

### 2. Brown the Tofu
Same pot. Add the smoked and firm tofu pieces. You don't need to press smoked tofu — it's already firm. Press the regular tofu first (tea towel, heavy pan, 15 minutes).

Brown the tofu on two sides — 2 minutes each. Remove and set aside.

{{< recipe-tip title="Why Smoked Tofu" type="philosophy" >}}
Smoked tofu in a curry is a cheat code. It's already got umami and smokiness built in. When it slow-cooks in spiced coconut sauce, it absorbs everything while keeping its structure. One pack smoked, one pack regular gives you two different textures in the same dish.

### 3. Build the Curry Base

Turn heat to medium. Add the onions. Cook 8-10 minutes until golden and soft. Add garlic, ginger, and chillies. Cook 2 minutes.

Add ALL the spices (except garam masala). Stir for 1 minute until fragrant and the onions are coated.

### 4. The Slow Cook
Pour in the coconut milk, chopped tomatoes, and stock. Stir and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom — that's flavour.

Add the lamb back in. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook on low heat for 40 minutes. The lamb needs time to get tender.

### 5. Add the Tofu
Add all the tofu. Stir gently — you don't want to break it up. Cook uncovered for another 15-20 minutes. The sauce should thicken and the tofu will drink it in.

### 6. Finish
Sprinkle in the garam masala. Stir. Taste. Adjust salt, add lime juice, more chilli if you want heat.

Scatter coriander on top. Serve with rice or naan.

## Be Kind to Future Self

This makes 8 big portions. It's a freezer hero.

- **Eat 2 tonight** — with too much naan
- **Fridge 2** — better the next day, honestly
- **Freeze 4** — into containers. Defrost overnight in the fridge. Reheat in a pan until bubbling. The tofu will have an even meatier texture after freezing.

**Rice tip:** Freeze rice in portions alongside the curry. Microwave from frozen — 3 minutes with a splash of water, covered.

## Make It Different

- **Use beef:** Swap lamb for braising steak. Same method, same timing.
- **Chicken version:** Use chicken thighs. Reduce slow-cook time to 25 minutes.
- **Hotter:** Add a scotch bonnet. You've been warned.
- **Creamier:** Stir in 2 tbsp yoghurt at the end (off the heat so it doesn't split).
- **More veg:** Throw in a diced aubergine with the onions, or a handful of spinach at the end.

Nothing is sacred. It's your curry.
